# neural_network_numpy
This repository for the beginners who wants to learn neural network and deep learning using python and numpy. In this repository you will find ipynb files having implementation of logisitc regression, neural networks and deep neural network. You can see I have written every singly line with comments for your better understanding.
I suggest bigenners not to use any machine learning, deep learning framework  or any high level API for learning.
If you start leaning from basics or python and numpy you will deeply understand the concepts.
Pre-Requisites are python, numpy and matplotlib.
