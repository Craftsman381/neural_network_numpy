# Neural_Network_numpy
This repository for the beginners who wants to learn neural network and deep learning using python and numpy. In this repository you will find **jupyter notebook** files having implementation of logisitc regression with neural network mindset, basic neural network for binary classfication with logistic loss and a deep neural network for binary classification. You can see I have written every single line with comments for your better understanding.
* I suggest beginners not to use any machine learning, deep learning framework  or any high level API for learning. Start learning from basics with python and numpy so you will deeply understand the concepts.
* **Pre-Requisites:**
    1. Basics of Machine Learning.
    2. Activation functions & loss.
    3. Forward and Backward Propagation.
    4. Python with numpy & matplotlib.
